I am experimenting here.

<div alight="center">
<p> 
Okay now, honey, lemme experiment here a little bit 'cause I gotta get this shit going on and see what's gon' happen.
It's actually interesting and I gotta create a few paragraphs actually. Now lemme end this paragraph right here, poolbear.
And, actually, <i>lemme add something else here <font size="+1">'cause I gotta make it bigger and see what's good.</font></i>
</p>
<p>
Okay, now this is a different paragraph and I yet don't know if I can apply a text color to a paragraph. But I gotta figure it out. By the way,
don't nobody should start a sentence with 'but'? But why?!
<b>I like it like this, baby!</b>
</p>
</div>
<tt>Let's see what's gonna happen to this one, shall we?
Sometimes life is difficult :S 
</tt>
<pre>And this has to have the same effect.
But I don't know... 
Such fun!
</pre>

<p>
<u>This is supposed to be underlined, let's see.</u>
</p>
<s>These tags "strike" and "s", they work the same way</s>
<br>
<strike>What's the point of using "strike" then?</strike>

<b><big>Oh, baby, I love it big! I wanna have a big dick</big></b>

<font face="verdana"> Now this font has a fancy name but let's look what it looks like! And let's make it a little bit bigger to see
what it will look like when there is more text.

By the way, I am not sure but I think I like typing. OMG.. </font>
